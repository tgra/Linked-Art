# Linked-Art



This repository includes an online interactive exemplar for the transformation of collections data to Linked Art JSON-LD. 

The aim of the exemplar is to demonstrate how easy it is to transform catalogue data to Linked Art JSON-LD.

The exemplar is in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) that can be viewed via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).


## How to view Jupyter Notebooks

### Anaconda
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) is a data science workbench that can be installed locally, that included Jupyter Notebook. To view all features of the notebook, it's recommended that you use Anaconda.

Anaconda is available to dowload at the bottom of the following page:  https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual


### Binder 
Binder is an online services that allows interactive Jupyter Notebooks to be viewed online. The following link will allows you to view the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository using Binder. Binder does not appear to support rendering of dynamic SVG, and this is why Anaconda is recommended in the first instance

## nbviewer
https://nbviewer.org/
nbviewer is an online service that will render a static view of a Jupyter notebook using a URL.

The following example will display the IMA transformation notebook:

https://nbviewer.org/github/tgra/Linked-Art/blob/04226e1b9dd8fd46aa39db46cac213dbc5b09c89/jupyter_notebooks/IMA%20-%20From%20Catalogue%20Data%20to%20Linked%20Art.ipynb

In GitHub there is an icon that will show the selected notebook in nbviewwer.

See the following, for an example - the icon is on the right-hand side of the document:
https://github.com/tgra/Linked-Art/blob/main/jupyter_notebooks//Catalogue_Data_to_Linked_Art_IMA.ipynb

### GitHub 
Github offers a static view of a Jupyter Notebook. Viewing the file in GitHub is simply a matter of selecting the relevant *.iynb file in the `jupyter_notebooks` folder
