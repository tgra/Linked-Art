# Linked-Art



This repository includes an online interactive exemplar for the transformation of collections data to Linked Art JSON-LD. 

The aim of the exemplar is to demonstrate how easy it is to transform catalogue data to Linked Art JSON-LD.

The exemplar is in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) that can be viewed via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
