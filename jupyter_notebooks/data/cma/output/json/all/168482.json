      "content": "American Presbyterian missionary Gertrude Hance (1844-1922), a native of Brookdale, Pennsylvania, who from 1870 to 1899 was stationed in what is today known as KwaZulu Natal. Her archive is preserved at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Upon her death in Binghamton, New York, the collection remained with the family until recently. Some of the works she acquired in the field were sold by her family at Sotheby's in New York in the 1980s. Others, however, including the two spoons illustrated here, remained in her family. The Rootenbergs bought them both from a member of the Hance family called Robert Pagano in 2007.",
