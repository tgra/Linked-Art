      "content": "With regard to provenance and exhibition history, I should also point out that before the pipe bowl under consideration appeared at the Bourne End Auction Rooms in London on May 10, 2011, the object was in the collection of David Lewin in London, who owned it since at least 2007. Indeed, the pipe bowl was included in an exhibition titled The Spirit of Africa: Southern Africa by Design, which he curated for the Clayarch Gimhae Museum in South Korea from April 24 to September 30, 2007. It is published in the accompanying catalogue of the same name on page 129.",
