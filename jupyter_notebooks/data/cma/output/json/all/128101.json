      "content": "the pyx was found in Lyons during the demolition of the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne adjoining the Cathedral of Saint-Jean.  Forgotten, hidden, it emerged as the choice object in a family collection in Lyons.  According to W. M. Milliken, tradition says that to satisfy a family heritage it was eventually divided into three parts, roughly one third, which was in the collection of M. G. Chalandon (the piece bought in 1951 by the CMA), and the remaining two thirds which went into the R\u00e9camier collection, and then into the collection of Claudius C\u00f4te (purchased by the CMA in 1952).",
