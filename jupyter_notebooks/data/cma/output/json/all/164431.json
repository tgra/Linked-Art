      "content": "The dealer, Mr. Terasaki, first saw this piece of bronze vessel at the art shop of Mr. Shimamoto about 10 years ago. It was reported that Mr. Shimamoto got it before World War II from a famous collector who owned a soap company, Mizura Co., and the piece came to Japan as early as the Meiji period. Six years ago, Mr. Terasaki acquired it from Mrs. Shimamoto.; Notably, this dealer, Mr. Terasaki, is a disciple of Mr. Sakamoto Goro of Hugen Do filin-a prominent Japanese collector/dealer of Chinese art, especially Chinese bronze. (The Cleveland set of ink bamboos of four seasons, Yuan dynasty Chinese paintings, was once collected by Mr. Sakamoto.) As confirmed by a curator of the Kyoto National Museum, Mr. Terasaki also supplies great works of art for the KNM.",
