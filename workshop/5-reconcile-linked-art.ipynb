    "\n",
    "The Linked Art reconciliation notebook provides a step through the process of reconciling geographical place names that occur in the title of artworks by the artist, John Ruskin. The data reconciliation will enrich the collections data with an additional representation of the geographical coordinates of the place depicted in the artworks. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin):\n",
    "<blockquote>\"John Ruskin (8 February 1819 – 20 January 1900) was an English writer, philosopher, art critic and polymath of the Victorian era. He wrote on subjects as varied as geology, architecture, myth, ornithology, literature, education, botany and political economy.\"</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "John Ruskin travelled extensively in Europe and was a prolific artist, creating drawings of paintings whose titles often included place names for the locations depicted. The title of the artworks has been recorded in the title field in many of the collection data records, and this has been used as the basis for the reconciliation process shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The place names are reconciled with the <a href=\"https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/\">Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)</a>, using the <a href=\"https://openrefine.org/\">Open Refine</a> tool and allows additional information to be associated with the artwork: \n",
    " - an authoritative global identifier for the geographical location depicted \n",
    " - geographical coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Data Files\n",
    "The Linked Art data files used in this notebook were created with the <a href=\"https://github.com/tgra/Linked-Art/blob/main/01-06-Transform-John-Ruskin.ipynb\">`01-06-Transform-John-Ruskin`</a> Jupyter notebook.\n"
