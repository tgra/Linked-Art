'''John Ruskin''' (8 February 1819 {{endash}} 20 January 1900) was an English writer, [[philosopher]], [[art critic]] and [[polymath]] of the [[Victorian era]]. He wrote on subjects as varied as [[geology]], [[architecture]], [[myth]], [[ornithology]], [[literature]], [[education]], [[botany]] and [[Critique of political economy|political economy]].

Ruskin's writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He wrote essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, architectural structures and ornamentation. The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society. 

Ruskin came to view his [[critique of political economy]] as his most central work, which also inspired the famous indian leader [[Mahatma Gandhi]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=G M,|first=Peter Swann.|title=""No Wealth But Life": When Does Mercantile Wealth Create Ruskinian Wealth?"|url=https://www.ersj.eu/repec/ers/papers/01_34_p2.pdf|url-status=live|website=European research studies journal.}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Radio|first=Sveriges|title=John Ruskin: En brittisk 1800-talsaristokrat för vår tid? - OBS|url=https://sverigesradio.se/avsnitt/1244376|access-date=2021-11-15|website=sverigesradio.se|language=sv}}</ref>

Ruskin was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the [[First World War]]. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in [[environmentalism]], [[sustainability]] and [[craft]].

Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of [[J. M. W. Turner]] in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is "truth to nature". From the 1850s, he championed the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]], who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], where he established the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art|Ruskin School of Drawing]]. In 1871, he began his monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain", published under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. As a result, he founded the [[Guild of St George]], an organisation that endures today.

==Early life (1819–1846)==

===Genealogy===
Ruskin was the only child of first cousins.<ref name="Intro">{{cite ODNB|author-link=Robert Hewison|first=Robert |last=Hewison| id=24291 | title=Ruskin, John (1819–1900)}}</ref> His father, John James Ruskin (1785–1864), was a sherry and wine importer,<ref name="Intro"/> founding partner and ''de facto'' business manager of Ruskin, Telford and Domecq (see [[Allied Domecq]]).

===Childhood and education===
[[File:John Ruskin by James Northcote.jpg|thumb|Ruskin as a young child, painted by [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]]]]
Ruskin was born on 8 February 1819 at 54 Hunter Street, [[Brunswick Square]], London (demolished 1969), south of [[St Pancras railway station]].<ref name="Childhood">''ODNB''  (2004) "Childhood and education"</ref> His childhood was shaped by the contrasting influences of his father and mother, both of whom were fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's [[Romanticism]]. They shared a passion for the works of [[Byron]], [[Shakespeare]] and especially [[Walter Scott]]. They visited Scott's home, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]], in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031012/ai_n12585843/] {{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Margaret Ruskin, an [[evangelical]] Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the [[Bible]] from beginning to end, and then to start all over again, committing large portions to memory.

John Wiley & Sons, 2010. p. 523</ref> He later wrote:

Ruskin's childhood was spent from 1823 at 28 [[Herne Hill]] (demolished {{circa|1912}}), near the village of [[Camberwell]] in [[South London]].<ref>J. S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin's Camberwell'' (Brentham Press for Guild of St George, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.</ref> He had few friends of his own age, but it was not the friendless and toyless experience he later said it was in his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89).<ref name="Childhood" /> He was educated at home by his parents and private tutors, including [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] preacher Edward Andrews,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Edward Andrews (1787–1841) {{!}} ERM|url=https://erm.selu.edu/notes/andrews_edward_note|access-date=2021-04-24|website=erm.selu.edu|archive-date=24 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210424171849/https://erm.selu.edu/notes/andrews_edward_note|url-status=dead}}</ref> whose daughters, Mrs Eliza Orme and [[Emily Augusta Patmore]] were later credited with introducing Ruskin to the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphelite Brotherhood]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Andrews Family {{!}} ERM|url=https://erm.selu.edu/notes/andrews_family_note|access-date=2021-04-24|website=erm.selu.edu|archive-date=19 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210419211239/https://erm.selu.edu/notes/andrews_family_note|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

From 1834 to 1835 he attended the school in [[Peckham]] run by the progressive evangelical [[Thomas Dale (priest)|Thomas Dale]] (1797–1870).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/individuals/dale_thomas.htm |title=UCL Bloomsbury Project |website=Ucl.ac.uk |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=1 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401033723/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/individuals/dale_thomas.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Ruskin heard Dale lecture in 1836 at [[King's College London|King's College, London]], where Dale was the first Professor of English Literature.<ref name="Childhood" /> Ruskin went on to enroll and complete his studies at [[King's College London|King's College]], where he prepared for [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] under Dale's tutelage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/johnkeats.aspx |title=King's College London – John Keats |website=Kcl.ac.uk |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=1 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401033728/https://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/johnkeats.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pookpress.co.uk/project/john-ruskin-biography/ |title=John Ruskin Biography >> Classic Stories |website=Pookpress.co.uk |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814225900/http://www.pookpress.co.uk/project/john-ruskin-biography/ |archive-date=14 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Travel===
[[File:Rose Terrace, Perth.JPG|thumb|10 Rose Terrace, Perth (on the right), where Ruskin spent boyhood holidays with Scottish relatives|220x220px]]
Ruskin was greatly influenced by the extensive and privileged travels he enjoyed in his childhood. It helped to establish his taste and augmented his education. He sometimes accompanied his father on visits to business clients at their country houses, which exposed him to English landscapes, architecture and paintings. Family tours took them to the [[Lake District]] (his first long poem, ''Iteriad'', was an account of his tour in 1830)<ref>John Ruskin, ''Iteriad, or Three Weeks Among the Lakes'', ed. James S. Dearden (Frank Graham, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> and to relatives in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland. As early as 1825, the family visited [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. Their continental tours became increasingly ambitious in scope: in 1833 they visited [[Strasbourg]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Milan]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]], places to which Ruskin frequently returned. He developed a lifelong love of the [[Alps]], and in 1835 visited [[Venice]] for the first time,<ref>[[Robert Hewison]], ''Ruskin and Venice: The Paradise of Cities'' (Yale University Press, 2009) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> that 'Paradise of cities' that provided the subject and symbolism of much of his later work.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=1.453n2}}

These tours gave Ruskin the opportunity to observe and record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant, though mainly conventional poetry, some of which was published in ''Friendship's Offering''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=Introduction}} His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by [[Samuel Rogers]]'s poem ''Italy'' (1830), a copy of which was given to him as a 13th birthday present; in particular, he  deeply admired the accompanying illustrations by [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Much of Ruskin's own art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and of [[Samuel Prout]], whose ''Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany'' (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, [[Copley Fielding]] and [[James Duffield Harding|J. D. Harding]].

===First publications===
Ruskin's journeys also provided inspiration for writing. His first publication was the poem "On Skiddaw and Derwent Water" (originally entitled "Lines written at the Lakes in Cumberland: Derwentwater" and published in the ''Spiritual Times'') (August 1829).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=2.265-8}} In 1834, three short articles for [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]]'s ''Magazine of Natural History'' were published. They show early signs of his skill as a close "scientific" observer of nature, especially its geology.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=1.191-6}}

From September 1837 to December 1838, Ruskin's ''The Poetry of Architecture'' was serialised in Loudon's ''Architectural Magazine'', under the pen name "Kata Phusin" (Greek for "According to Nature").{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=1.4-188}} It was a study of cottages, villas, and other dwellings centred on a Wordsworthian argument that buildings should be sympathetic to their immediate environment and use local materials. It anticipated key themes in his later writings. In 1839, Ruskin's "Remarks on the Present State of Meteorological Science" was published in ''Transactions of the Meteorological Society''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=1.206-10}}

===Oxford===
In [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] 1836, Ruskin [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]], taking up residence at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in January of the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017013829/http://artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |archive-date=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Enrolled as a [[gentleman-commoner]], he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers. Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the greatest advantage of his time there was in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, always encouraged him, as did a young senior tutor, [[Henry Liddell]] (later the father of [[Alice Liddell]]) and a private tutor, the Rev [[Osborne Gordon]].<ref>Cynthia Gamble, ''John Ruskin, Henry James and the Shropshire Lads'' (New European Publications, 2008) chapters 3–4.</ref> He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, [[William Buckland]]. Among his fellow-undergraduates, Ruskin's most important friends were [[Charles Thomas Newton]] and [[Henry Acland]].

His most noteworthy success came in 1839 when, at the third attempt, he won the prestigious [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry ([[Arthur Hugh Clough]] came second).<ref>For his winning poem, "Salsette and Elephanata", Cook and Wedderburn 2.90–100.</ref> He met [[William Wordsworth]], who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony.

Ruskin's health was poor and he never became independent from his family during his time at Oxford. His mother took lodgings on High Street, where his father joined them at weekends. He was devastated to hear that his first love, Adèle Domecq, the second daughter of his father's business partner, had become engaged to a French nobleman. In April 1840, whilst revising for his examinations, he began to cough blood, which led to fears of consumption and a long break from Oxford travelling with his parents.<ref>[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 54–56.</ref>

Before he returned to Oxford, Ruskin responded to a challenge that had been put to him by [[Effie Gray]], whom he later married: the twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at [[Leamington Spa]] to undergo Dr Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fable ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' (not published until December 1850 (but imprinted 1851), with illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=1.VI.305-54}} A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.<ref>James S. Dearden, "The King of the Golden River: A Bio-Bibliographival Study" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik, ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 32–59.</ref> Back at Oxford, in 1842 Ruskin sat for a pass degree, and was awarded an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.<ref>Bradley, Alexander. “Ruskin at Oxford: Pupil and Master”, p. 750, ''Studies in English Literature'', 1500-1900 32, no. 4 (1992): 747–64.

===''Modern Painters I'' (1843)===
[[File:Portrait of John Ruskin (4671937).jpg|thumb|Engraving of John Ruskin by Henry Sigismund Uhlrich]]
For much of the period from late 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin was abroad with his parents, mainly in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], to whom the Ruskins were introduced by [[Joseph Severn]], a friend of [[Keats]] (whose son, Arthur Severn, later married Ruskin's cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner's pictures exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. It recalled an attack by the critic Rev [[John Eagles]] in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner, who did not wish it to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.<ref>[[Dinah Birch]] (ed.) ''Ruskin on Turner'' (Cassell, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Before Ruskin began ''[[Modern Painters]]'', John James Ruskin had begun collecting watercolours, including works by [[Samuel Prout]] and Turner. Both painters were among occasional guests of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, and 163 [[Denmark Hill]] (demolished 1947) to which the family moved in 1842.

What became the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), published by [[Smith, Elder & Co.]] under the anonymous authority of "A Graduate of Oxford", was Ruskin's answer to [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]'s critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/index.htm |title=the electronic edition of John Ruskin's "Modern Painters" Volume I |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=28 June 2002 |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=18 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318002345/http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/index.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Ruskin controversially argued that modern landscape painters—and in particular Turner—were superior to the so-called "[[Old Masters]]" of the post-[[Renaissance]] period. Ruskin maintained that, unlike Turner, Old Masters such as [[Gaspard Dughet]] (Gaspar Poussin), [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], and [[Salvator Rosa]] favoured pictorial convention, and not "truth to nature". He explained that he meant "moral as well as material truth".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=3.104}} The job of the artist is to observe the reality of nature and not to invent it in a studio{{mdash}}to render imaginatively on canvas what he has seen and understood, free of any rules of composition. For Ruskin, modern landscapists demonstrated superior understanding of the "truths" of water, air, clouds, stones, and vegetation, a profound appreciation of which Ruskin demonstrated in his own prose. He described works he had seen at the [[National Gallery]] and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] with extraordinary verbal felicity.

Although critics were slow to react and the reviews were mixed, many notable literary and artistic figures were impressed with the young man's work, including [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].<ref>Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Early Years'' (Yale University Press, 1985) p. 73.</ref> Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin's relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued nearly 20,000 sketches that Turner gave to the British nation.

===1845 tour and ''Modern Painters II'' (1846)===
Ruskin toured the continent with his parents again in 1844, visiting [[Chamonix]] and [[Paris]], studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Perugino]] among others at the [[Louvre]]. In 1845, at the age of 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In [[Lucca]] he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by [[Jacopo della Quercia]], which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the then object of his love, [[Rose La Touche]]). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]], and in [[Florence]]. In [[Venice]], he was particularly impressed by the works of [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Giotto]] in [[San Marco|St Mark's Cathedral]], and [[Tintoretto]] in the [[Scuola di San Rocco]], but he was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on the city: "Venice is lost to me", he wrote.<ref>Q. in Harold I. Shapiro (ed.), ''Ruskin in Italy: Letters to His Parents 1845'' (Clarendon Press, 1972), pp.200–01.</ref> It finally convinced him that architectural restoration was destruction, and that the only true and faithful action was preservation and conservation.

Drawing on his travels, he wrote the second volume of ''Modern Painters'' (published April 1846).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=4.25-218}} The volume concentrated on Renaissance and pre-Renaissance artists rather than on Turner. It was a more theoretical work than its predecessor. Ruskin explicitly linked the aesthetic and the divine, arguing that truth, beauty and religion are inextricably bound together: "the Beautiful as a gift of God".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=4.47 (''Modern Painters II'')}} In defining categories of beauty and imagination, Ruskin argued that all great artists must perceive beauty and, with their imagination, communicate it creatively by means of symbolic representation. Generally, critics gave this second volume a warmer reception, although many found the attack on the aesthetic orthodoxy associated with [[Joshua Reynolds]] difficult to accept.<ref>See J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984),  pp. 88–95.</ref> In the summer, Ruskin was abroad again with his father, who still hoped his son might become a poet, even [[poet laureate]], just one among many factors increasing the tension between them.

==Middle life (1847–1869)==

===Marriage to Effie Gray===
During 1847, Ruskin became closer to [[Effie Gray]], the daughter of family friends. It was for her that Ruskin had written ''[[The King of the Golden River]]''. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], once the residence of the Ruskin family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day0507.html |title=May 7th 1828 |publisher=Perthshire Diary |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019211655/http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day0507.html |archive-date=19 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin's grandfather). Owing to this association and other complications, Ruskin's parents did not attend. The European [[Revolutions of 1848]] meant that the newlyweds' earliest travels together were restricted, but they were able to visit [[Normandy]], where Ruskin admired the [[Gothic architecture]].

Their early life together was spent at 31 Park Street, [[Mayfair]], secured for them by Ruskin's father (later addresses included nearby 6 Charles Street, and 30 Herne Hill). Effie was too unwell to undertake the European tour of 1849, so Ruskin visited the [[Alps]] with his parents, gathering material for the third and fourth volumes of ''[[Modern Painters]]''. He was struck by the contrast between the Alpine beauty and the poverty of Alpine peasants, stirring his increasingly sensitive social conscience.

The marriage was unhappy, with Ruskin reportedly being cruel to Effie and distrustful of her. The marriage was never [[Consummation|consummated]] and was annulled six years later in 1854.<ref>For the wider context, see Robert Brownell, ''A Marriage of Inconvenience: John Ruskin, Effie Gray, John Everett Millais and the surprising truth about the most notorious marriage of the nineteenth century'' (Pallas Athene, 2013).{{page needed|date=December 2020}}</ref>

===Architecture===
Ruskin's developing interest in architecture, and particularly in the [[Gothic revival|Gothic]], led to the first work to bear his name, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' (1849).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=8.3-274}} It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. All would provide recurring themes in his future work. ''Seven Lamps'' promoted the virtues of a secular and Protestant form of Gothic. It was a challenge to the Catholic influence of architect [[A. W. N. Pugin]].

===''The Stones of Venice''===<!-- A link within this page points to this section; avoid renaming it. -->
In November 1849, Effie and John Ruskin visited [[Venice]], staying at the Hotel Danieli.<ref>Mary Lutyens, ''Effie in Venice'' (John Murray, 1965); reprinted as ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin written from Venice, between 1849–1852'' (Vanguard Press, 1967; new edition: Pallas Athene, 2001).</ref> Their different personalities are thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace, or Palazzo Ducale]], because he feared that they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of these troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, became friendly with Effie, apparently with Ruskin's consent. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

Meanwhile, Ruskin was making the extensive sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] (1851–53).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/eSoV/index.html |title=Ruskin's Venetian Notebooks 1849–50 |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=20 March 2008 |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=8 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008172602/http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/eSoV/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>For [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] see Cook and Wedderburn vols. 9–11.</ref> Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, ''Stones'' reflected Ruskin's view of contemporary England. It served as a warning about the moral and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly degenerated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.

The chapter, "The Nature of Gothic" appeared in the second volume of ''Stones''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=10.180–269}} Praising Gothic ornament, Ruskin argued that it was an expression of the artisan's joy in free, creative work. The worker must be allowed to think and to express his own personality and ideas, ideally using his own hands, rather than machinery.

{{Quote|text=We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.|author=John Ruskin|source=''The Stones of Venice'' vol. II: Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.}}

This was both an aesthetic attack on, and a social critique of, the [[division of labour]] in particular, and [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]] in general. This chapter had a profound impact, and was reprinted both by the [[Christian socialist]] founders of the [[Working Men's College]] and later by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] pioneer and socialist [[William Morris]].<ref>Fiona MacCarthy, ''William Morris'' (Faber and Faber, 1994) pp. 69–70, 87.</ref>

===Pre-Raphaelites===
[[File:Millais Ruskin.jpg|thumb|''[[John Ruskin (painting)|John Ruskin]]'' painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[John Everett Millais]] standing at [[Glenfinlas]], Scotland, (1853–54)<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 886970|title = Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinals|journal = The Burlington Magazine|volume = 138|issue = 1117|pages = 228–234|last1 = Grieve|first1 = Alastair|year = 1996}}</ref>]]

[[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had established the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848. The Pre-Raphaelite commitment to 'naturalism'&nbsp;– "paint[ing] from nature only",{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=12.357n}} depicting nature in fine detail, had been influenced by Ruskin.

Ruskin came into contact with Millais after the artists made an approach to Ruskin through their mutual friend [[Coventry Patmore]].<ref>[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 137–49.</ref> Initially, Ruskin had not been impressed by Millais's ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' (1849–50), a painting that was considered blasphemous at the time, but Ruskin wrote letters defending the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to ''[[The Times]]'' in May 1851.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=12.319–335}} Providing Millais with artistic patronage and encouragement, in the summer of 1853 the artist (and his brother) travelled to Scotland with Ruskin and Effie where, at [[Glenfinlas]], he painted the closely observed landscape background of [[gneiss]] rock to which, as had always been intended, he later added [[John Ruskin (painting)|Ruskin's portrait]].

Millais had painted Effie for ''[[The Order of Release|The Order of Release, 1746]]'', exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1852. Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely with her husband and his intense and overly protective parents, and sought solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already fatally undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.

In April 1854, Effie filed her [[annulment|suit of nullity]], on grounds of "non-consummation" owing to his "incurable [[impotence|impotency]]",<ref>Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 236.</ref><ref>Sir William James, ''The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais'', 1946, p. 237</ref> a charge Ruskin later disputed.<ref>Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, p. 87</ref> Ruskin wrote, "I can prove my virility at once."<ref>Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 192.</ref> The annulment was granted in July. Ruskin did not even mention it in his diary. Effie married Millais the following year. The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of enduring speculation and debate.

Ruskin continued to support [[William Holman Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]. He also provided an annuity of £150 in 1855–57 to [[Elizabeth Siddal]], Rossetti's wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of [[Henry Acland]] for her medical care).<ref name="ReferenceA">''ODNB'': "Critic of Contemporary Art".</ref> Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial support from Ruskin, including [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[John William Inchbold]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], who became a good friend (he called him "Brother Ned").<ref>W. G. Collingwood, ''Life and Work of John Ruskin'' (Methuen, 1900) p. 402.</ref> His father's disapproval of such friends was a further cause of considerable tension between them.

During this period Ruskin wrote regular reviews of the annual exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] under the title ''Academy Notes'' (1855–59, 1875).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=vol. 14}} They were highly influential, capable of making or breaking reputations. The satirical magazine ''[[punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' published the lines (24 May 1856), "I paints and paints,/hears no complaints/And sells before I'm dry,/Till savage Ruskin/He sticks his tusk in/Then nobody will buy."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=udKymsQhKMEC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31#v=onepage&q=I%20paints%20and%20paints%2C%2Fhears%20no%20complaints%2FAnd%20sells%20before%20I%E2%80%99m%20dry%2C%2FTill%20savage%20Ruskin%20sticks%20his%20tusk%20in%2FThen%20nobody%20will%20buy ] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Ruskin was an art-philanthropist: in March 1861 he gave 48 [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] drawings to the [[Ashmolean]] in [[Oxford]], and a further 25 to the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]] in May.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |title=Fitzwilliam Museum Collections Explorer |website=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |access-date=18 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903031532/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |archive-date=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Ruskin's own work was very distinctive, and he occasionally exhibited his watercolours: in the United States in 1857–58 and 1879, for example; and in England, at the Fine Art Society in 1878, and at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolour (of which he was an honorary member) in 1879. He created many careful studies of natural forms, based on his detailed botanical, geological and architectural observations.<ref>The relation between Ruskin, his art and criticism, was explored in the exhibition Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites (Tate Britain, 2000), curated by Robert Hewison, Stephen Wildman and Ian Warrell.</ref> Examples of his work include a painted, floral pilaster decoration in the central room of [[Wallington Hall]] in Northumberland, home of his friend [[Pauline Trevelyan]]. The [[Stained glass|stained glass window]] in the ''Little Church of St Francis'' Funtley, [[Fareham, Hampshire]] is reputed to have been designed by him. Originally placed in the ''St. Peter's Church'' Duntisbourne Abbots near [[Cirencester]], the window depicts the Ascension and the Nativity.<ref>Malcolm Low & Julie Graham, ''The stained glass window of the Little Church of St. Francis'', private publication August 2002 & April 2006, for viewing Fareham Library reference Section or the [[Westbury Manor Museum]] Ref: section Fareham, hants; [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m.low1/funtley/funtleychurch.htm The stained glass window of the Church of St. Francis.

Ruskin's theories also inspired some architects to adapt the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive "Ruskinian Gothic".<ref>J. Mordaunt Crook, "Ruskinian Gothic", in ''The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin'', ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 65–93.</ref> Through his friendship with [[Henry Acland]], Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] (designed by [[Benjamin Woodward]])—which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed to satisfy Ruskin completely. The many twists and turns in the Museum's development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities' less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.<ref>Michael Brooks, ''John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture'' (Thames and Hudson, 1991), p. 127.</ref>

===Ruskin and education===
The [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Museum]] was part of a wider plan to improve science provision at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. Ruskin's first formal teaching role came about in the mid-1850s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/john_ruskin.htm |title=John Ruskin on education |website=Infed.org |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=29 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029115422/http://www.infed.org/thinkers/john_ruskin.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> when he taught drawing classes (assisted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]) at the [[Working Men's College]], established by the [[Christian socialists]], [[Frederick James Furnivall]] and [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805231329/http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |archive-date=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Although Ruskin did not share the founders' politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=13.553}} One result of this involvement was Ruskin's ''Elements of Drawing'' (1857).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=15.23-232}} He had taught several women drawing, by means of correspondence, and his book represented both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals.<ref>''ODNB''.</ref> The WMC was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]].<ref>Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 226.</ref>

From 1859 until 1868, Ruskin was involved with the progressive school for girls at [[Winnington Hall]] in Cheshire. A frequent visitor, letter-writer, and donor of pictures and geological specimens to the school, Ruskin approved of the mixture of sports, handicrafts, music and dancing encouraged by its principal, Miss Bell.<ref>''The Winnington Letters: John Ruskin's correspondence with Margaret Alexis Bell and the children at Winnington Hall,'' ed. Van Akin Burd (Harvard University Press, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> The association led to Ruskin's sub-Socratic work, ''The Ethics of the Dust'' (1866), an imagined conversation with Winnington's girls in which he cast himself as the "Old Lecturer".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=18.197–372}} On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it is a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, [[Whitelands College]], a training college for teachers, where he instituted a [[May Queen]] festival that endures today.<ref>Malcolm Cole, ''"Be Like Daisies": John Ruskin and the Cultivation of Beauty at Whitelands College (Guild of St George Ruskin Lecture 1992)'' (Brentham Press for The Guild of St George, 1992).</ref> (It was also replicated in the 19th century at the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] High School for Girls.) Ruskin also bestowed books and gemstones upon [[Somerville College]], one of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s first two [[women's college]]s, which he visited regularly, and was similarly generous to other educational institutions for women.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Manuel|first1=Anne|title=Breaking New Ground: A History of Somerville College as seen through its Buildings|page=12|date=2013|publisher=Somerville College|location=Oxford}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108093838/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |archive-date=8 January 2015 }}</ref>

===''Modern Painters III'' and ''IV''===
Both volumes III and IV of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' were published in 1856.<ref>Respectively, Cook and Wedderburn vols. 5 and 6.</ref> In ''MP'' III Ruskin argued that all great art is "the expression of the spirits of great men".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=5.69}} Only the morally and spiritually healthy are capable of admiring the noble and the beautiful, and transforming them into great art by imaginatively penetrating their essence. ''MP'' IV presents the geology of the Alps in terms of landscape painting, and their moral and spiritual influence on those living nearby. The contrasting final chapters, "The Mountain Glory" and "The Mountain Gloom"<ref>Francis O'Gorman, "Ruskin's Mountain Gloom", in Rachel Dickinson and Keith Hanley (eds), ''Ruskin's Struggle for Coherence: Self-Representation through Art, Place and Society'' (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), pp. 76–89.</ref> provide an early example of Ruskin's social analysis, highlighting the poverty of the peasants living in the lower Alps.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=5.385–417, 418–68}}<ref>Alan Davis, "Ruskin's Dialectic: Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory", in ''Ruskin Programme Bulletin'', no. 25 (January 2001), pp. 6–8</ref>

===Public lecturer===
In addition to leading more formal teaching classes, from the 1850s Ruskin became an increasingly popular public lecturer. His first public lectures were given in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. His lectures at the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], Manchester in 1857, were collected as ''The Political Economy of Art'' and later under [[Keats]]'s phrase, ''A Joy For Ever''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=16.9-174}} In these lectures, Ruskin spoke about how to acquire art, and how to use it, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and that art is an index of a nation's well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin's interventions outraged his father and the [[Manchester School of economics|"Manchester School" of economists]], as represented by a hostile review in the ''[[Manchester Examiner and Times]]''.<ref>J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 202–205.</ref> As the Ruskin scholar Helen Gill Viljoen noted, Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.<ref>Most of Viljoen's work remains unpublished, but has been explored by Van Akin Burd and James L.

Ruskin gave the inaugural address at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858, an institution from which the modern-day [[Anglia Ruskin University]] has grown.<ref>For the address itself, see Cook and Wedderburn 16.177–206, and for the wider context: Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and Cambridge" in ''The Companion'' (Newsletter of The Guild of St. George) no.7 (2007), pp.8–10.

The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, during which they visited [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].

===Turner Bequest===
Ruskin had been in Venice when he heard about [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner's]] death in 1851. Being named an executor to Turner's will was an honour that Ruskin respectfully declined, but later took up. Ruskin's book in celebration of the sea, ''The Harbours of England'', revolving around Turner's drawings, was published in 1856.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=13.9–80}} In January 1857, Ruskin's ''Notes on the Turner Gallery at [[Marlborough House]], 1856'' was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=13.95–186}} He persuaded the [[National Gallery]] to allow him to work on the Turner Bequest of nearly 20,000 individual artworks left to the nation by the artist. This involved Ruskin in an enormous amount of work, completed in May 1858, and involved cataloguing, framing and conserving.<ref>For the catalogues, Cook and Wedderburn 19.187–230 and 351–538. For letters, see 13.329-50 and further notes, 539–646.</ref> Four hundred watercolours were displayed in cabinets of Ruskin's own design.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Recent scholarship has argued that Ruskin did not, as previously thought, collude in the destruction of Turner's erotic drawings,<ref>Ian Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1 (Spring 2003), pp. 15–46.</ref> but his work on the Bequest did modify his attitude towards Turner.<ref>Alan Davis, "Misinterpreting Ruskin: New light on the 'dark clue' in the basement of the National Gallery, 1857–58" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 35–64.</ref> (See below, [[#Turner's erotic drawings|Controversies: Turner's Erotic Drawings]].)

===Religious "unconversion"===
In 1858, Ruskin was again travelling in Europe. The tour took him from [[Switzerland]] to [[Turin]], where he saw [[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Presentation of the [[Queen of Sheba]]''. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon, led to his "unconversion" from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=29.89}} He had, however, doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, shaken by Biblical and geological scholarship that had undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the Bible:<ref>Michael Wheeler, ''Ruskin's God'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.</ref> "those dreadful hammers!" he wrote to [[Henry Acland]], "I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=36.115}} This "loss of faith" precipitated a considerable personal crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths.<ref>{{cite web |author=George P.

Although in 1877 Ruskin said that in 1860, "I gave up my art work and wrote ''[[Unto This Last]]'' ... the central work of my life" the break was not so dramatic or final.<ref>E. T. Cook, ''The Life of John Ruskin'' (2 vols., 2nd edn., George Allen, 1912), vol. 2, p. 2.</ref> Following his crisis of faith, and influenced in part by his friend [[Thomas Carlyle]] (whom he had first met in 1850), Ruskin shifted his emphasis in the late 1850s from art towards social issues. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a wide range of subjects including art and, among many other matters, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (''The Cestus of Aglaia''), botany and mythology (''Proserpina'' and ''The Queen of the Air''). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel extensively across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to [[Abbeville]], and in the following year he was in [[Verona]] (studying tombs for the [[Arundel Society]]) and [[Venice]] (where he was joined by [[William Holman Hunt]]). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]], and the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theories of [[political economy]] underpinning it. He repudiated his sometimes grandiloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly.<ref>On the importance of words and language: Cook and Wedderburn 18.65, 18.64, and 20.75.</ref>

|source=<small>John Ruskin, ''[[Unto This Last]]'': Cook and Wedderburn, 17.105</small>}}

Ruskin's social view broadened from concerns about the dignity of labour to consider issues of citizenship and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by [[John Stuart Mill]], based on theories of [[laissez-faire]] and competition drawn from the work of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus]]. In his four essays ''[[Unto This Last]]'', Ruskin rejected the [[division of labour]] as dehumanising (separating the labourer from the product of his work), and argued that the false "science" of [[political economy]] failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. He articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics.<ref>For the sources of Ruskin's social and political analysis: James Clark Sherburne, ''John Ruskin or The Ambiguities of Abundance: A Study in Social and Economic Criticism'' (Harvard University Press, 1972 {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> For Ruskin, all economies and societies are ideally founded on a politics of [[social justice]]. His ideas influenced the concept of the "[[social economy]]", characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]].

The essays were originally published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' between August and November 1860 (and published in a single volume in 1862).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.15–118}} However, the ''Cornhill'''s editor, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of the magazine's largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher ([[Smith, Elder & Co.]]). The reaction of the national press was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, "reprobated in a violent manner".<ref>Cook and Wedderburn 4.122n. For the press reaction: J. L. Bradley (ed.) ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 273–89.</ref> Ruskin's father also strongly disapproved.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=36.415}} Others were enthusiastic, including Ruskin's friend [[Thomas Carlyle]], who wrote, "I have read your paper with exhilaration... such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads... will do a great deal of good."<ref>Q. in James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications, 2004), pp. 34–35.</ref>

Ruskin's political ideas, and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' in particular, later proved highly influential. The essays were praised and paraphrased in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], a wide range of autodidacts cited their positive impact, the economist [[John A. Hobson]] and many of the founders of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour party]] credited them as an influence.<ref>For the influence of Ruskin's social and political thought: Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (I.B.

Ruskin believed in a hierarchical social structure. He wrote "I was, and my father was before me, a violent Tory of the old school."<ref>Cook and Wedderburn 27.167 and 35.13.</ref> He believed in man's duty to God, and while he sought to improve the conditions of the poor, he opposed attempts to level social differences and sought to resolve social inequalities by abandoning capitalism in favour of a co-operative structure of society based on obedience and benevolent philanthropy, rooted in the agricultural economy.

Ruskin's explorations of nature and aesthetics in the fifth and final volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' focused on [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Titian]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]]. Ruskin asserted that the components of the greatest artworks are held together, like human communities, in a quasi-organic unity. Competitive struggle is destructive.

Ruskin's next work on political economy, redefining some of the basic terms of the discipline, also ended prematurely, when ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', under the editorship of [[James Anthony Froude]], cut short his ''Essays on Political Economy'' (1862–63) (later collected as ''Munera Pulveris'' (1872)).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.129–298}} Ruskin further explored political themes in ''Time and Tide'' (1867),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.309–484}} his letters to Thomas Dixon, a cork-cutter in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear]] who had a well-established interest in literary and artistic matters. In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation.

Ruskin's sense of politics was not confined to theory. On his father's death in 1864, he inherited a considerable fortune of between £120,000 and £157,000 (the exact figure is disputed).<ref>Francis O' Gorman gives the figure as £120,000, in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Sutton Publishing, 1999) p. 62 as does James S. Dearden (who adds that property, including paintings, was valued at £3000), in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications, 2004), p. 37. Robert Hewison's ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' entry for Ruskin, however, states £157,000 plus £10,000 in pictures (section: "A Mid-Life Crisis"). The National Probate Calendar states simply, 'under £200,000.</ref> This considerable fortune, inherited from the father he described on his tombstone as "an entirely honest merchant",{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.lxxvii}} gave him the means to engage in personal philanthropy and practical schemes of social amelioration. One of his first actions was to support the housing work of [[Octavia Hill]] (originally one of his art pupils): he bought property in [[Marylebone]] to aid her philanthropic housing scheme.<ref>Gillian Darley, ''Octavia Hill: A Life'' (Constable, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> But Ruskin's endeavours extended to the establishment of a shop selling pure tea in any quantity desired at 29 Paddington Street, [[Paddington]] (giving employment to two former Ruskin family servants) and crossing-sweepings to keep the area around the [[British Museum]] clean and tidy. Modest as these practical schemes were, they represented a symbolic challenge to the existing state of society. Yet his greatest practical experiments would come in his later years.

===Lectures in the 1860s===
Ruskin lectured widely in the 1860s, giving the [[Rede lecture]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1867, for example.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=19.163-94}} He spoke at the [[British Institution]] on 'Modern Art', the Working Men's Institute, [[Camberwell]] on "Work" and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] on 'War.'<ref>Dearden,James S.(2018)."Why are there so few 'Wars'? A John Ruskin Rarity."[[The Book Collector]] 67 no.1 (spring):79-82.</ref>Ruskin's widely admired lecture, ''Traffic'', on the relation between taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at [[Bradford]] Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/block1.html |title=Moral Taste in Ruskin's "Traffic" |website=Victorianweb.org |date=13 November 2006 |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=23 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323023231/http://www.victorianweb.org//authors/ruskin/block1.html |url-status=live }}</ref> "I do not care about this Exchange", Ruskin told his audience, "because ''you'' don't!"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=18.433}} These last three lectures were published in ''The Crown of Wild Olive'' (1866).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=18.383–533}}

[[File:Library Walk 29.JPG|thumb|"For all books are divisible into two classes: the books of the hour, and the books of all time" – ''Sesame and Lilies'']]
The lectures that comprised ''Sesame and Lilies'' (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at [[Rusholme]] and [[Manchester]], are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. "Of Kings' Treasuries" (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. "Of Queens' Gardens" (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin's most popular, and was regularly awarded as a [[Sunday School]] prize.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=18.19-187}} Its reception over time, however, has been more mixed, and twentieth-century feminists have taken aim at "Of Queens' Gardens" in particular, as an attempt to "subvert the new heresy" of [[women's rights]] by confining women to the domestic sphere.<ref>Kate Millett, ''Sexual Politics'' (New York: Doubleday and Co.), 1970, p. 91.</ref> Although indeed subscribing to the Victorian belief in "separate spheres" for men and women, Ruskin was however unusual in arguing for parity of esteem, a case based on his philosophy that a nation's political economy should be modelled on that of the ideal household.

==Later life (1869–1900)==

===Oxford's first Slade Professor of Fine Art===
[[File:Vanity Fair Caricature of Ruskin.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[Adriano Cecioni]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1872]]
Ruskin was unanimously appointed the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University]] in August 1869, though largely through the offices of his friend, [[Henry Acland]].<ref>Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 165–68.</ref> He delivered his inaugural lecture on his 51st birthday in 1870, at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] to a larger-than-expected audience. It was here that he said, "The art of any country is the exponent of its social and political virtues." It has been claimed that [[Cecil Rhodes]] cherished a long-hand copy of the lecture, believing that it supported his own view of the British Empire.<ref>Richard Symonds, 'Oxford and the Empire', in [[M. G. Brock]] and M. C. Curthoys (eds.), ''The History of the University of Oxford, vol. VII: Nineteenth-Century Oxford, part 2'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 689–716, specifically p. 691.</ref>

In 1871, John Ruskin founded his own art school at [[Oxford]], [[The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/Ruskin%20School%20of%20Art%20RS.pdf |title=Oxford University Archives &#124; Home |website=Oua.ox.ac.uk |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924062551/http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/Ruskin%20School%20of%20Art%20RS.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> It was originally accommodated within the [[Ashmolean Museum]] but now occupies premises on High Street. Ruskin endowed the drawing mastership with £5000 of his own money. He also established a large collection of drawings, watercolours and other materials (over 800 frames) that he used to illustrate his lectures. The School challenged the orthodox, mechanical methodology of the government art schools (the "South Kensington System").<ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996">See Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Ruskin's lectures were often so popular that they had to be given twice—once for the students, and again for the public. Most of them were eventually published (see [[#Select_bibliography|Select Bibliography]] below). He lectured on a wide range of subjects at Oxford, his interpretation of "Art" encompassing almost every conceivable area of study, including wood and metal engraving (''Ariadne Florentina''), the relation of science to art (''The Eagle's Nest'') and sculpture (''Aratra Pentelici''). His lectures ranged through myth, ornithology, geology, nature-study and literature. "The teaching of Art...", Ruskin wrote, "is the teaching of all things."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=29.86}} Ruskin was never careful about offending his employer. When he criticised [[Michelangelo]] in a lecture in June 1871 it was seen as an attack on the large collection of that artist's work in the [[Ashmolean Museum]].<ref>Francis O' Gorman,  ''John Ruskin'' (Pocket Biographies) (Sutton Publishing, 1999) p. 78.</ref>

Most controversial, from the point of view of the University authorities, spectators and the national press, was the digging scheme on [[Ferry Hinksey Road]] at [[North Hinksey]], near [[Oxford]], instigated by Ruskin in 1874, and continuing into 1875, which involved undergraduates in a road-mending scheme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/3780 |title=John Ruskin green plaque |publisher=Open Plaques |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=19 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019211657/http://openplaques.org/plaques/3780 |url-status=live }}</ref> The scheme was motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour. Some of the diggers, who included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Alfred Milner]] and Ruskin's future secretary and biographer [[W. G. Collingwood]], were profoundly influenced by the experience: notably [[Arnold Toynbee (historian, born 1852)|Arnold Toynbee]], Leonard Montefiore and [[Alexander Robertson MacEwen]]. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the [[settlement movement|university settlements]],<ref>Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 103–09.</ref> and was keenly celebrated by the founders of [[Ruskin College|Ruskin Hall, Oxford]].<ref>Stuart Eagles, "Ruskin the Worker: Hinksey and the Origins of Ruskin Hall, Oxford" in ''Ruskin Review and Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3 (Autumn 2008), pp. 19–29.</ref>

In 1879, Ruskin resigned from Oxford, but resumed his Professorship in 1883, only to resign again in 1884.<ref>Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 399–400, 509–10.</ref> He gave his reason as opposition to [[vivisection]],<ref>Jed Mayer, "Ruskin, Vivisection, and Scientific Knowledge" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 35, no. 1 (Spring 2008) (Guest Editor, Sharon Aronofsky Weltman), pp. 200–22.</ref> but he had increasingly been in conflict with the University authorities, who refused to expand his [[Ruskin School of Drawing|Drawing School]].<ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"/> He was also suffering from increasingly poor health.

===''Fors Clavigera'' and the Whistler libel case===
In January 1871, the month before Ruskin started to lecture the wealthy undergraduates at [[Oxford University]], he began his series of 96 (monthly) "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–84). (The letters were published irregularly after the 87th instalment in March 1878.) These letters were personal, dealt with every subject in his oeuvre, and were written in a variety of styles, reflecting his mood and circumstances. From 1873, Ruskin had full control over all his publications, having established [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]] as his sole publisher (see [[Allen & Unwin]]).

In the July 1877 letter of ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'', Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by [[James McNeill Whistler]] exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He found particular fault with [[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket|''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'']], and accused Whistler of asking two hundred guineas for "flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=29.160}}<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 Linda Merrill, ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v.

The trial took place on 25 and 26 November, and many major figures of the art world at the time appeared at the trial. Artist [[Albert Joseph Moore|Albert Moore]] appeared as a witness for Whistler, and artist [[William Powell Frith]] appeared for Ruskin. Frith said "the nocturne in black in gold is not in my opinion worth two hundred guineas". [[Frederic Leighton]] also agreed to give evidence for Whistler, but in the end could not attend as he had to go to Windsor to be knighted.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lambourne|first=Lionel|title=The Aesthetic Movement|publisher=[[Phaidon Press]]|year=1996|isbn=0714830003|location=London|chapter=Chapter 5}}</ref> Edward Burne-Jones, representing Ruskin, also asserted that ''Nocturne in Black and Gold'' was not a serious work of art. When asked to give reasons, Burne-Jones said he had never seen one painting of [[night]] that was successful, but also acknowledged that he saw marks of great labour and artistic skill in the painting. In the end, Whistler won the case, but the jury awarded damages of only a derisory [[British farthing coin|farthing]] (the smallest coin of the realm) to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription organised by the [[Fine Art Society]], but Whistler was bankrupt within six months, and was forced to sell his studio. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, and may have accelerated his mental decline.<ref>For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13–34.</ref> It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin's exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.<ref>Cook and Wedderburn 29.469, the passage in ''Sesame and Lilies'' printed in "blood-red".</ref>

===Guild of St George===

Ruskin founded his utopian society, the [[Guild of St George]], in 1871 (although originally it was called St George's Fund, and then St George's Company, before becoming the Guild in 1878). Its aims and objectives were articulated in ''[[Fors Clavigera]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=27–29}} A communitarian protest against nineteenth-century industrial capitalism, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called "Companions".<ref>For the Guild's original constitution and articles of association: Cook and Wedderburn 30.3–12</ref> Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed by traditional means, in harmony with the environment, and with the minimum of mechanical assistance.<ref>[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1940&datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235259/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1940&datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}</ref> He also sought to educate and enrich the lives of industrial workers by inspiring them with beautiful objects. As such, with a tithe (or personal donation) of £7,000, Ruskin acquired land and a collection of art treasures.<ref>On the origins of the Guild: Mark Frost, ''The Lost Companions and John Ruskin's Guild of St George, a revisionary history'' (Anthem Press, 2014); and Edith Hope Scott, ''Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Methuen, 1931).</ref>

In principle, Ruskin worked out a scheme for different grades of "Companion", wrote codes of practice, described styles of dress and even designed the Guild's own coins.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=28.417–38 and 28.13–29}} Ruskin wished to see St George's Schools established, and published various volumes to aid its teaching (his ''Bibliotheca Pastorum'' or ''Shepherd's Library''), but the schools themselves were never established.<ref>Sara Atwood, ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 151–64.</ref> (In the 1880s, in a venture loosely related to the ''Bibliotheca'', he supported [[Francesca Alexander]]'s publication of some of her tales of peasant life.) In reality, the Guild, which still exists today as a charitable education trust, has only ever operated on a small scale.<ref>For a short, illustrated history of the Guild: James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Guild of St George, 2010).</ref>

Ruskin also wished to see traditional rural handicrafts revived. St. George's Mill was established at [[Laxey]], [[Isle of Man]], producing cloth goods. The Guild also encouraged independent but allied efforts in spinning and weaving at [[Langdale]], in other parts of the [[Lake District]] and elsewhere, producing linen and other goods exhibited by the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] and similar organisations.<ref>Sara E. Haslam, ''John Ruskin and the Lakeland Arts Revival, 1880–1920'' (Merton Priory Press, 2004) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>

The Guild's most conspicuous and enduring achievement was the creation of a remarkable collection of art, minerals, books, medieval manuscripts, architectural casts, coins and other precious and beautiful objects. Housed in a cottage museum high on a hill in the [[Sheffield]] district of [[Walkley]], it opened in 1875, and was curated by Henry and Emily Swan.<ref>Janet Barnes, ''Ruskin and Sheffield'' (Guild of St Georgel, 2018).</ref> Ruskin had written in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' III (1856) that, "the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to ''see'' something, and to tell what it ''saw'' in a plain way."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=5.333}} Through the Museum, Ruskin aimed to bring to the eyes of the working man many of the sights and experiences otherwise reserved for those who could afford to travel across Europe. The original Museum has been digitally recreated online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ruskinatwalkley.org/ |title=Ruskin at Walkley |publisher=Ruskin at Walkley |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=6 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706022159/https://www.ruskinatwalkley.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1890, the Museum relocated to [[Meersbrook Park]].

===Rose La Touche===
[[File:Portrait of Rose La Touche 1861 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rose La Touche'', as sketched by Ruskin]]
Ruskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by [[Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford]]. Maria La Touche, a minor Irish poet and novelist, asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858. [[Rose La Touche]] was ten. His first meeting came at a time when Ruskin's own religious faith was under strain. This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting.<ref>Robert Dunlop, ''Plantation of Renown: The Story of the La Touche Family of Harristown and the Baptist Church at Brannockstown in Co. Kildare'' [1970]. Revised and enlarged edition, 1982; "Ruskin's "Wild Rose of Kildare", pp. 29–41.</ref> A chance meeting at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact. After a long illness, she died on 25 May 1875, at the age of 27. These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving a number of breakdowns and delirious visions. The first of these had occurred in 1871 at [[Matlock, Derbyshire]], a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels, whose flora, fauna, and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature.

Ruskin turned to [[spiritualism]]. He attended seances at [[Broadlands]]. Ruskin's increasing need to believe in a meaningful universe and a [[life after death]], both for himself and his loved ones, helped to revive his Christian faith in the 1870s.

===Travel guides===
Ruskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''St Ursula'' in [[Venice]], a vision of which, associated with [[Rose La Touche]] would haunt him, described in the pages of ''[[Fors Clavigera|Fors]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=27.344}} In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited [[Sicily]], the furthest he ever travelled.

Ruskin embraced the emerging literary forms, the travel guide (and gallery guide), writing new works, and adapting old ones "to give", he said, "what guidance I may to travellers..."<ref>Cook and Wedderburn 23.293. For further study, see Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).</ref> ''The Stones of Venice'' was revised, edited and issued in a new "Travellers' Edition" in 1879. Ruskin directed his readers, the would-be traveller, to look with his cultural gaze at the landscapes, buildings and art of France and Italy: ''Mornings in Florence'' (1875–77), ''The Bible of Amiens'' (1880–85) (a close study of its sculpture and a wider history), ''St Mark's Rest'' (1877–84) and ''A Guide to the Principal Pictures in ... Venice'' (1877).

===Final writings===
[[File:John Ruskin, 1882.jpg|thumb|John Ruskin in 1882]]
In the 1880s, Ruskin returned to some literature and themes that had been among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about [[Walter Scott|Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] in ''Fiction, Fair and Foul'' (1880){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=34.265–397}} in which, as Seth Reno argues, he describes the devastating effects on the landscape caused by industrialization, a vision Reno sees as a realization of the [[Anthropocene]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Seth |last=Reno |chapter=The Cradle of the Anthropocene |publisher=Palgrave |title=Early Anthropocene Literature in Britain, 1750-1884}}</ref> He returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, ''The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century'' (1884),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=34.7–80}} describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin's ''Storm-Cloud'' has been seen as foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries.<ref>Michael Wheeler (ed.), ''Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).</ref> Ruskin's prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy.

His last great work was his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=35.5-562}} (meaning, 'Of Past Things'), a highly personalised, selective, eloquent but incomplete account of aspects of his life, the preface of which was written in his childhood nursery at [[Herne Hill]].

The period from the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too difficult for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete mental collapse on his final tour, which included [[Beauvais]], [[Sallanches]] and [[Venice]], in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the [[Aesthetic movement]] and [[Impressionism]] distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the doctrine of "l'art pour l'art" or "art for art's sake" that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he seemed to be more interested in book illustrators such as [[Kate Greenaway]] than in modern art. He also attacked aspects of [[Darwinism|Darwinian theory]] with increasing violence, although he knew and respected [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] personally.

===Brantwood and final years===
[[File:John Ruskin's grave, and family plot - geograph.org.uk - 1231315.jpg|thumb|Grave of John Ruskin, in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] churchyard]]
In August 1871, Ruskin purchased, from [[W. J. Linton]], the then somewhat dilapidated [[Brantwood]] house, on the shores of [[Coniston Water]], in the English [[Lake District]], paying £1500 for it. [[Brantwood]] was Ruskin's main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: he had an ice house built, and the gardens comprehensively rearranged. He oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the ''Jumping Jenny''), and he altered the house (adding a dining room, a turret to his bedroom to give him a panoramic view of the lake, and he later extended the property to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream and craggy rocks rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.<ref>For an illustrated history of Brantwood, see James S. Dearden, ''Brantwood: The Story of John Ruskin's Coniston Home'' (Ruskin Foundation, 2009).</ref>

Although Ruskin's 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1899 (various Ruskin societies presenting him with an elaborately illuminated congratulatory address), Ruskin was scarcely aware of it.<ref>[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1674&datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235342/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1674&datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}</ref> He died at [[Brantwood]] from influenza on 20 January 1900 at the age of 80. He was buried five days later in the churchyard at [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], according to his wishes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/M076100/John-Ruskins-Grave-at-Coniston?img=163&search=RANDOM&cat=&bool=and |title=Look and Learn History Picture Library |website=Lookandlearn.com |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019211708/http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/M076100/John-Ruskins-Grave-at-Coniston?img=163&search=RANDOM&cat=&bool=and |archive-date=19 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As he had grown weaker, suffering prolonged bouts of mental illness, he had been looked after by his second cousin, Joan(na) Severn (formerly "companion" to Ruskin's mother) and she and her family inherited his estate. ''Joanna's Care'' was the eloquent final chapter of Ruskin's memoir, which he dedicated to her as a fitting tribute.<ref>For Ruskin's relationship with Joan Severn, see ''John Ruskin's Correspondence with Joan Severn: Sense and Nonsense Letters'' ed. Rachel Dickinson (Legenda, 2008).</ref>

Joan Severn, together with Ruskin's secretary, [[W. G. Collingwood]], and his eminent American friend [[Charles Eliot Norton]], were executors to his will. [[E. T. Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume ''Library Edition'' of Ruskin's ''Works'', the last volume of which, an index, attempts to demonstrate the complex interconnectedness of Ruskin's thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin's public and personal reputation.<ref>James Spates has written about the effects of this, based on the research work of Helen Viljoen. See James L. Spates, 'John Ruskin's Dark Star: New Lights on His Life Based on the Unpublished Biographical Materials and Research of Helen Gill Viljoen', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', vol. 82, no. 1, Spring 2000 [published 2001], 135–91.</ref>

The centenary of Ruskin's birth was keenly celebrated in 1919, but his reputation was already in decline and sank further in the fifty years that followed.<ref>Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 246–48.</ref> The contents of Ruskin's home were dispersed in a series of sales at auction, and [[Brantwood]] itself was bought in 1932 by the educationist and Ruskin enthusiast, collector and memorialist, [[John Howard Whitehouse]].<ref>See James S. Dearden, ''Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood: the Growth of the Whitehouse Collection'' (Ryburn, 1994).</ref>

[[Brantwood]] was opened in 1934 as a memorial to Ruskin and remains open to the public today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brantwood.org.uk/ |title=Museum, Arts Centre & Self Catering Accommodation Coniston |website=Brantwood.org.uk |date=14 April 2017 |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704091942/http://www.brantwood.org.uk/ |archive-date=4 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Guild of St George]] continues to thrive as an educational charity, and has an international membership.<ref>See {{cite web |url=http://www.guildofstgeorge.org.uk/ |title=The Guild of St George |website=guildofstgeorge.org.uk |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-date=26 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226061214/https://www.guildofstgeorge.org.uk/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Ruskin Society organises events throughout the year.<ref>See {{cite web |url=http://theruskinsociety.com/ |title=The Ruskin Society |website=theruskinsociety.com |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904071719/https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/widget_iframe.f88235f49a156f8b4cab34c7bc1a0acc.html?origin=http%3A%2F%2Ftheruskinsociety.com |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Note on Ruskin's personal appearance===
[[File:Portrait of John Ruskin at Brantwood.jpg|thumb|Portrait of John Ruskin, leaning against a wall at Brantwood]]
In middle age, and at his prime as a lecturer, Ruskin was described as slim, perhaps a little short,<ref>Alexander MacEwen, who attended Ruskin's lectures at Oxford, reported that the papers described him thus. See David Smith Cairns, ''Life and times of Alexander Robertson MacEwen, D.D'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1925), pp. 30–31.</ref> with an aquiline nose and brilliant, piercing blue eyes. Often sporting a double-breasted waistcoat, a high collar and, when necessary, a frock coat, he also wore his trademark blue neckcloth.<ref>See [[H. W. Nevinson]], ''Changes and Chances'' (James Nisbet, 1923), pp. 53–55 and [[J. A. Spender]], ''Life, Journalism and Politics'' (Cassell & Co., 1927), p. 192.</ref> From 1878 he cultivated an increasingly long beard, and took on the appearance of an "Old Testament" prophet.

===Ruskin in the eyes of a student===
The following description of Ruskin as a lecturer was written by an eyewitness, who was a student at the time (1884):

{{Quote|author=Stephen Gwynn|source=''Experiences of a Literary Man'' (1926)<ref name="Gwynn">Stephen Gwynn, ''Experiences of a Literary Man'', Thornton Butterworth, 1926, pages 39–41</ref>|text=[Ruskin’s] election to the second term of the Slade professorship took place in 1884, and he was announced to lecture at the Science Schools, by the park. I went off, never dreaming of difficulty about getting into any professorial lecture; but all the accesses were blocked, and finally I squeezed in between the Vice-Chancellor and his attendants as they forced a passage. All the young women in Oxford and all the girls’ schools had got in before us and filled the semi-circular auditorium. Every inch was crowded, and still no lecturer; and it was not apparent how he could arrive. Presently there was a commotion in the doorway, and over the heads and shoulders of tightly packed young men, a loose bundle was handed in and down the steps, till on the floor a small figure was deposited, which stood up and shook itself out, amused and good humoured, climbed on to the dais, spread out papers and began to read in a pleasant though fluting voice. Long hair, brown with grey through it; a soft brown beard, also streaked with grey; some loose kind of black garment (possibly to be described as a frock coat) with a master’s gown over it; loose baggy trousers, a thin gold chain round his neck with glass suspended, a lump of soft tie of some finely spun blue silk; and eyes much bluer than the tie: that was Ruskin as he came back to Oxford.}}

An incident where the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] master [[William Morris]] had aroused the anger of [[James Franck Bright|Dr Bright]], Master of [[University College, Oxford]], served to demonstrate Ruskin's charisma:

{{Quote|author=Stephen Gwynn|source=''Experiences of a Literary Man'' (1926)<ref name="Gwynn" />|text=William Morris had come to lecture on "Art and plutocracy" in the hall of University College. The title did not suggest an exhortation to join a Socialist alliance, but that was what we got. When he ended, the Master of University, Dr Bright, stood up and instead of returning thanks, protested that the hall had been lent for a lecture on art and would certainly not have been made available for preaching Socialism. He stammered a little at all times, and now, finding the ungracious words literally stick in his throat, sat down, leaving the remonstrance incomplete but clearly indicated. The situation was most unpleasant. Morris at any time was choleric and his face flamed red over his white shirt front: he probably thought he had conceded enough by assuming against his usage a conventional garb. There was a hubbub, and then from the audience Ruskin rose and instantly there was quiet. With a few courteous well chosen sentences he made everybody feel that we were an assembly of gentlemen, that Morris was not only an artist but a gentleman and an Oxford man, and had said or done nothing which gentlemen in Oxford should resent; and the whole storm subsided before that gentle authority.}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Gandhi smiling 1942.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Gandhi was inspired by Ruskins work [[Unto This Last|''Unto This Last'']].]]

===International===
Ruskin's influence reached across the world. [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] described him as "one of the most remarkable men not only of England and of our generation, but of all countries and times" and quoted extensively from him, rendering his ideas into Russian.<ref>Stuart Eagles, ''Ruskin and Tolstoy'' (2nd edn) (Guild of St George, 2016) p. 12.</ref> [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French.<ref>Cynthia J. Gamble, ''Proust as Interpreter of Ruskin. The Seven Lamps of Translation'' (Summa Publications, 2002) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] wrote of the "magic spell" cast on him by ''[[Unto This Last]]'' and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it ''[[Sarvodaya]]'', "The Advancement of All".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin's translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his cultured pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.<ref>Masami Kimura, "Japanese Interest in Ruskin: Some Historical Trends" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik (eds.), ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 215–44.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Catalogue of the Ryuzo Mikimoto Collection : Ruskin Library, Tokyo 2004 |date=1 April 2017 |oclc = 56923207}}</ref>

A number of utopian socialist [[Ruskin Colonies]] attempted to put his political ideals into practice. These communities included [[Ruskin, Florida]], [[Ruskin, British Columbia]] and the [[Ruskin Colony|Ruskin Commonwealth Association]], a colony in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] in existence from 1894 to 1899.

Ruskin's work has been translated into numerous languages including, in addition to those already mentioned (Russian, French, Japanese): German, Italian, Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Czech, Chinese, Welsh, several Indian languages like Kannada (ಕನ್ನಡ), [[Esperanto]] and [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]].

[[File:Ruskin Cannery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cannery operation in the Ruskin Cooperative, 1896]]
===Art, architecture and literature===
Theorists and practitioners in a broad range of disciplines acknowledged their debt to Ruskin. Architects including [[Le Corbusier]], [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]] incorporated his ideas in their work.<ref>Rebecca Daniels and Geoff Brandwood (ed.), ''Ruskin and Architecture'' (Spire Books, 2003) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> Writers as diverse as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Ezra Pound]] felt Ruskin's influence.<ref>W. G. Collingwood, ''Life and Work of John Ruskin'' (Methuen, 1900) p. 260.</ref> The American poet [[Marianne Moore]] was an enthusiastic Ruskin reader. Art historians and critics, among them [[Herbert Read]], [[Roger Fry]] and [[Wilhelm Worringer]], knew Ruskin's work well.<ref>Giovanni Cianci and Peter Nicholls (eds.), ''Ruskin and Modernism'' (Palgrave, 2001), and Toni Cerutti (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Twentieth Century: The modernity of Ruskinism'' (Edizioni Mercurio, 2000).</ref> Admirers ranged from the British-born American watercolourist and engraver [[John William Hill]] to the sculptor-designer, printmaker and utopianist [[Eric Gill]]. Aside from [[E. T. Cook]], Ruskin's editor and biographer, other leading British journalists influenced by Ruskin include [[J. A. Spender]], and the war correspondent [[H. W. Nevinson]].

===Craft and conservation===
[[William Morris]] and [[C. R. Ashbee]] (of the Guild of Handicraft) were keen disciples, and through them Ruskin's legacy can be traced in the [[arts and crafts movement]]. Ruskin's ideas on the preservation of open spaces and the conservation of historic buildings and places inspired his friends [[Octavia Hill]] and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]] to help found the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].<ref>[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill Download Samuel Jones (ed.), ''The Enduring Relevance of Octavia Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618093500/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill |date=18 June 2012 }} and see specifically, Robert Hewison, "'You are doing some of the work that I ought to do': Octavia Hill and Ruskinian values", pp. 57–66.</ref>

===Society, education and sport===
Pioneers of [[urban planning|town planning]] such as [[Thomas Coglan Horsfall]] and [[Patrick Geddes]] called Ruskin an inspiration and invoked his ideas in justification of their own social interventions; likewise the founders of the [[garden city movement]], [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Raymond Unwin]].<ref>Michael H. Lang ''Designing Utopia: John Ruskin's Urban Vision for Britain and America'' (Black Rose Books, 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>

[[Edward Carpenter]]'s community in Millthorpe, Derbyshire was partly inspired by Ruskin, and John Kenworthy's colony at [[Purleigh]], Essex, which was briefly a refuge for the [[Doukhobor]]s, combined Ruskin's ideas and Tolstoy's.

The most prolific collector of Ruskiniana was [[John Howard Whitehouse]], who saved Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and opened it as a permanent Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin's educational ideals, Whitehouse established [[Bembridge School]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to [[Michael Ernest Sadler]] wrote about and appreciated Ruskin's ideas.<ref>For a full discussion of Ruskin and education, see Sara Atwood, ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011).</ref> [[Ruskin College]], an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for working men, was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and [[Charles A. Beard]].

Ruskin's innovative publishing experiment, conducted by his one-time [[Working Men's College]] pupil [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]], whose business was eventually merged to become [[Allen & Unwin]], anticipated the establishment of the [[Net Book Agreement]].

Ruskin's Drawing Collection, a collection of 1470 works of art he gathered as learning aids for the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] (which he founded at Oxford), is at the [[Ashmolean Museum]]. The Museum has promoted Ruskin's art teaching, utilising the collection for in-person and online drawing courses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ruskin.ashmolean.org/collection/8994/ |title=The Elements of Drawing |access-date=4 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914235852/http://ruskin.ashmolean.org/collection/8994 |archive-date=14 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Pierre de Coubertin]], the innovator of the modern [[Olympic Games]], cited Ruskin's principles of beautification, asserting that the games should be "Ruskinised" to create an aesthetic identity that transcended mere championship competitions.<ref>[[Arnd Krüger]], "'The masses are much more sensitive to the perfection of the whole than to any separate details': The Influence of John Ruskin's Political Economy on Pierre de Coubertin", in [https://www.uwo.ca/olympic/files/pdf/olympika/tocs/olympika-05-1996-toc.pdf ''Olympika'', 1996 Vol. V] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200817052210/https://www.uwo.ca/olympic/files/pdf/olympika/tocs/olympika-05-1996-toc.pdf |date=17 August 2020 }}, pp. 25–44; Arnd Krüger, "Coubertin's Ruskianism", in: R.

===Politics and critique of political economy===
Ruskin was an inspiration for many [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], and his ideas informed the work of economists such as [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]] and [[J. A. Hobson]], and the positivist [[Frederic Harrison]].<ref>Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (Tauris, 2007) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> Ruskin was discussed in university extension classes, and in reading circles and societies formed in his name. He helped to inspire the [[settlement movement]] in Britain and the United States. Resident workers at [[Toynbee Hall]] such as the future civil servants [[Hubert Llewellyn Smith]] and [[William Beveridge]] (author of the [[Beveridge Report|Report ... on Social Insurance and Allied Services]]), and the future Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] acknowledged their debt to Ruskin as they helped to found the British [[welfare state]]. More of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]'s earliest MPs acknowledged Ruskin's influence than mentioned [[Karl Marx]] or the Bible.<ref>Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The social and political legacies of a Victorian prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Oxford University Press, 1999).</ref> More recently, Ruskin's works have also influenced [[Phillip Blond]] and the [[Red Tory]] movement.<ref>{{cite news|title=Red Tory intrigues and infuriates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/30/phillip-blond-red-tory-respublica|work=The Guardian|first=Madeleine|last=Bunting|date=30 March 2010|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-date=4 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904071720/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/30/phillip-blond-red-tory-respublica|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:John Ruskin Street in London.JPG|thumb|right|John Ruskin Street in [[Walworth, London|Walworth]], London]]
Many streets, buildings, organisations and institutions bear his name: [[The Priory Ruskin Academy]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire; [[John Ruskin College]], South Croydon; and [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in [[Chelmsford]] and [[Cambridge]], which traces its origins to the Cambridge School of Art, at the foundation of which Ruskin spoke in 1858. Also, the Ruskin Literary and Debating Society, (founded in 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the oldest surviving club of its type, and still promoting the development of literary knowledge and public speaking today; and the Ruskin Art Club in Los Angeles, which still exists. In addition, there is the [[Ruskin Pottery]], [[Ruskin House]], Croydon and [[Ruskin Hall]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

[[Ruskin, Florida]], United States—site of one of the short-lived American [[Ruskin Colleges]]—is named after John Ruskin. There is a mural of Ruskin titled "Head, Heart and Hands" on a building across from the Ruskin Post Office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5RcPIY4KU0 |title=Ruskin Community Mural |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=4 March 2009 |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904071719/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5RcPIY4KU0 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since 2000, scholarly research has focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] and [[Oliver Lodge]] admired him.

Ruskin wrote over 250 works, initially art criticism and history, but expanding to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, [[literary criticism]], the environmental effects of pollution, mythology, travel, political economy and social reform. After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume "Library Edition", completed in 1912 by his friends [[Edward Tyas Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/hcookwed01.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904075826/https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/hcookwed01.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, cause certain difficulties. In 1898, [[John A. Hobson]] observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, "the spell of his eloquence is broken".<ref>[[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]], ''John Ruskin: Social Reformer'' (J. Nisbet & Co., 1898), p. viii.</ref> [[Clive Wilmer]] has written, further, that, "The anthologising of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts [... is] something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start."<ref>[[Clive Wilmer]] (ed.), ''Unto This Last and Other Writings'' (Penguin, 1985), pp. 36–37.</ref> Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin's theory and criticism require further consideration.

===Art and design criticism===
Ruskin's early work defended the reputation of [[J. M. W. Turner]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190207-was-ruskin-the-most-important-man-of-the-last-200-years |title=Was Ruskin the most important man of the last 200 years? |access-date=24 February 2019 |archive-date=26 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226141108/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190207-was-ruskin-the-most-important-man-of-the-last-200-years |url-status=live }}</ref> He believed that all great art should communicate an understanding and appreciation of nature. Accordingly, inherited artistic conventions should be rejected. Only by means of direct observation can an artist, through form and colour, represent nature in art. He advised artists in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' I to: "go to Nature in all singleness of heart... rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=3.624}} By the 1850s. Ruskin was celebrating the Pre-Raphaelites, whose members, he said, had formed "a new and noble school" of art that would provide a basis for a thoroughgoing reform of the art world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites |title=Ruskin, Turner and The Pre-Raphaelites |website=Tate.org.uk |date=7 January 2000 |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-date=5 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405225922/http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites |url-status=live }}</ref> For Ruskin, art should communicate truth above all things. However, this could not be revealed by mere display of skill, and must be an expression of the artist's whole moral outlook. Ruskin rejected the work of [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] because he considered it to epitomise a reductive mechanisation of art.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Ruskin's strong rejection of [[Classicism|Classical tradition]] in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' typifies the inextricable mix of aesthetics and morality in his thought: "Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralysed in its old age... an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortified."<ref>Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice'', iii, ch. iv, §35; Cook and Wedderburn 11.227.</ref> Rejection of mechanisation and standardisation informed Ruskin's theories of architecture, and his emphasis on the importance of the Medieval Gothic style. He praised the Gothic for what he saw as its reverence for nature and natural forms; the free, unfettered expression of artisans constructing and decorating buildings; and for the organic relationship he perceived between worker and guild, worker and community, worker and natural environment, and between worker and God. Attempts in the 19th century to reproduce Gothic forms (such as pointed arches), attempts he had helped inspire, were not enough to make these buildings expressions of what Ruskin saw as true Gothic feeling, faith, and organicism.

For Ruskin, the Gothic style in architecture embodied the same moral truths he sought to promote in the visual arts. It expressed the 'meaning' of architecture—as a combination of the values of strength, solidity and aspiration—all written, as it were, in stone. For Ruskin, creating true Gothic architecture involved the whole community, and expressed the full range of human emotions, from the [[wikt:sublime|sublime]] effects of soaring spires to the comically ridiculous carved [[grotesque]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. Even its crude and "savage" aspects were proof of "the liberty of every workman who struck the stone; a freedom of thought, and rank in scale of being, such as no laws, no charters, no charities can secure."<ref>John Unrau, "Ruskin, the Workman and the Savageness of Gothic", in ''New Approaches to Ruskin'', ed [[Robert Hewison]], 1981, pp. 33–50</ref> [[Classical architecture]], in contrast, expressed a morally vacuous and repressive standardisation. Ruskin associated Classical values with modern developments, in particular with the demoralising consequences of the [[industrial revolution]], resulting in buildings such as [[The Crystal Palace]], which he criticised.<ref>Cook and Wedderburn 12.417–32. Cynthia J. Gamble, "John Ruskin: conflicting responses to Crystal Palace" in Françoise Dassy and Catherine Hajdenko-Marshall (eds.), ''Sociétés et conflit: enjeux et représentation'' (L'Harmattan et l'Université de Cergy-Pontoise, 2006), pp. 135–49.</ref> Although Ruskin wrote about architecture in many works over the course of his career, his much-anthologised essay "The Nature of Gothic" from the second volume of ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1853) is widely considered to be one of his most important and evocative discussions of his central argument.

Ruskin's theories indirectly encouraged a revival of Gothic styles, but Ruskin himself was often dissatisfied with the results. He objected that forms of mass-produced ''faux'' Gothic did not exemplify his principles, but showed disregard for the true meaning of the style. Even the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], a building designed with Ruskin's collaboration, met with his disapproval. The [[O'Shea and Whelan|O'Shea brothers]], freehand stone carvers chosen to revive the creative "freedom of thought" of Gothic craftsmen, disappointed him by their lack of reverence for the task.

Ruskin's distaste for oppressive standardisation led to later works in which he attacked ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism, which he thought was at its root. His ideas provided inspiration for the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], the founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]], and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].

Ruskin's views on art, wrote [[Kenneth Clark]], "cannot be made to form a [[logical system]], and perhaps owe to this fact a part of their value." Ruskin's accounts of art are descriptions of a superior type that conjure images vividly in the mind's eye.<ref>{{cite book

Clark neatly summarises the key features of Ruskin's writing on art and architecture:
<blockquote>
# Art is not a matter of taste, but involves the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.
# Even the most superior mind and the most powerful imagination must found itself on facts, which must be recognised for what they are. The imagination will often reshape them in a way which the prosaic mind cannot understand; but this recreation will be based on facts, not on formulas or illusions.
# These facts must be perceived by the senses, or felt; not learnt.
# The greatest artists and schools of art have believed it their duty to impart vital truths, not only about the facts of vision, but about religion and the conduct of life.
# Beauty of form is revealed in organisms which have developed perfectly according to their laws of growth, and so give, in his own words, 'the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function.'
# This fulfilment of function depends on all parts of an organism cohering and co-operating. This was what he called the 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.
# Good art is done with enjoyment. The artist must feel that, within certain reasonable limits, he is free, that he is wanted by society, and that the ideas he is asked to express are true and important.
# Great art is the expression of epochs where people are united by a common faith and a common purpose, accept their laws, believe in their leaders, and take a serious view of human destiny.<ref>Kenneth Clark, "A Note on Ruskin's Writings on Art and Architecture", in idem, ''Ruskin Today'' (John Murray, 1964) (reissued as ''Selected Writings'', Penguin, 1991), pp. 133–34.</ref>
</blockquote>

===Historic preservation===
Ruskin's belief in preservation of ancient buildings had a significant influence on later thinking about the distinction between conservation and restoration. He was a strong proponent of the former, while his contemporary, [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], promoted the latter. In ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'', (1849) Ruskin wrote:

{{Quote|text=Neither by the public, nor by those who have the care of public monuments, is the true meaning of the word ''restoration'' understood. It means the most total destruction which a building can suffer: a destruction out of which no remnants can be gathered: a destruction accompanied with false description of the thing destroyed. Do not let us deceive ourselves in this important matter; it is ''impossible'', as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture.|source=<small>''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.242.</small>}}

This abhorrence of restoration is in marked contrast to Viollet-le-Duc, who wrote that restoration is a "means to reestablish [a building] to a finished state, which may in fact never have actually existed at any given time."<ref>Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. ([1854] 1990). ''The foundations of architecture''. New York: George Braziller. p. 195. (Translated by Kenneth D. Whitehead from the original French.)</ref>

For Ruskin, the "age" of a building was crucially significant as an aspect in its preservation: "For, indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, not in its gold. Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity."<ref>''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.233–34.</ref>

===Critique of political economy===
Ruskin wielded a [[critique of political economy]] of orthodox, 19th-century [[political economy]] principally on the grounds that it failed to acknowledge complexities of human desires and motivations (broadly, "social affections"). He began to express such ideas in ''The Stones of Venice'', and increasingly in works of the later 1850s, such as ''The Political Economy of Art'' (''A Joy for Ever''), but he gave them full expression in the influential essays, ''Unto This Last''.{{Quote|text=[...] the art of becoming "rich," in the common sense, is not absolutely nor finally the art of accumulating much money for ourselves, but also of contriving that our neighbours shall have less. In accurate terms, it is "the art of establishing the maximum inequality in our own favour."|author=Ruskin|title=Unto this last}}

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Nay, but I choose my physician and my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work. By all means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward of the good workman, to be "chosen." The natural and right system respecting all labour is, that it should be paid at a fixed rate, but the good workman employed, and the bad workman unemployed. The false, unnatural, and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half-price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by his competition to work for an inadequate sum.|source=<small>Cook and Wedderburn, 17.V.34 (1860).</small> }}

At the root of his theory, was Ruskin's dissatisfaction with the role and position of the worker, and especially the artisan or craftsman, in modern [[capitalism|industrial capitalist]] society. Ruskin believed that the economic theories of [[Adam Smith]], expressed in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' had led, through the [[division of labour]] to the alienation of the worker not merely from the process of work itself, but from his fellow workmen and other classes, causing increasing resentment. (See ''[[#The_Stones_of_Venice|The Stones of Venice]]'' above.)

Ruskin argued that one remedy would be to pay work at a fixed rate of wages, because human need is consistent and a given quantity of work justly demands a certain return. The best workmen would remain in employment because of the quality of their work (a focus on quality growing out of his writings on art and architecture). The best workmen could not, in a fixed-wage economy, be undercut by an inferior worker or product.

In the preface to ''Unto This Last'' (1862), Ruskin recommended that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and 'gentleness and justice'; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with idlers compelled to toil; and pensions provided for the elderly and the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.17–24}} Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the [[welfare state]].<ref>Jose Harris, "Ruskin and Social Reform", in Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 7–33, specifically p. 8.</ref>

== Controversies ==

===Turner's erotic drawings===<!-- A link within this page points to this section; avoid renaming it. -->
Until 2005, biographies of both [[J. M. W. Turner]] and Ruskin had claimed that in 1858 Ruskin burned bundles of erotic paintings and drawings by Turner to protect Turner's posthumous reputation. Ruskin's friend [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], who was Keeper of the [[National Gallery]], was said to have colluded in the alleged destruction of Turner's works. In 2005, these works, which form part of the Turner Bequest held at [[Tate Britain]], were re-appraised by Turner Curator Ian Warrell, who concluded that Ruskin and Wornum had not destroyed them.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1381143,00.html ''The Guardian'' report on the discovery of Turner's drawings.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904075825/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/31/arts.artsnews |date=4 September 2021 }} Also see Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol.

===Sexuality===
Ruskin's sexuality has been the subject of a great deal of speculation and critical comment. His one marriage, to [[Effie Gray]], was annulled after six years owing to non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that Ruskin found her "person" repugnant:  <blockquote>  He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848]. </blockquote> Ruskin told his lawyer during the annulment proceedings:  <blockquote> It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.<ref>Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 191</ref> </blockquote>The cause of Ruskin's "disgust" has led to much conjecture. [[Mary Lutyens]] speculated that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of nudes which lacked pubic hair.<ref>Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 156</ref> However, [[Peter Fuller]] wrote, "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood."<ref>Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' (Chatto & Windus, 1988), pp. 11–12</ref> Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also took the view that menstruation was the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. There is no evidence to support any of these theories. [[William Ewart Gladstone]] said to his daughter Mary, "should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin [for the breakdown of the marriage], remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless."<ref>Q. in J. Howard Whitehouse, ''Vindication of Ruskin'' (George Allen & Unwin, 1950), p. 53.</ref> The fullest story of the Ruskins' marriage to date has been told by the scholar Robert Brownell.<ref>See Robert Brownell, ''A Marriage of Inconvenience: John Ruskin, Effie Gray, John Everett Millais and the surprising truth about the most notorious marriage of the nineteenth century'' (Pallas Athene, 2013).</ref>

Ruskin's later relationship with [[Rose La Touche]] has led to claims that he started a correspondence with her when he met her at the age of nine.<ref>Current evidence suggests that she was ten when they met, but Ruskin states in his autobiography that she was only nine. Robert Hewison, ''John Ruskin: The Argument of the Eye'', p.160; [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/06/biography.peterconrad Proust and Gandhi revered him. It's hard to see why... ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215011701/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/06/biography.peterconrad |date=15 December 2019 }}" (review of John Batchelor, ''John Ruskin: No Wealth but Life''), ''The Guardian'', 6 February 2000.</ref> In fact, he did not approach her as a suitor until on or near her eighteenth birthday. She asked him to wait for her until she was 21. Receiving no answer, he repeated his proposal.{{cn|date=August 2021}}

Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose's spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time.<ref>Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'', p. 553, "absolutely under her [Rose's] orders I have asked Tenny Watson to marry me and come abroad with her father."</ref> It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to [[Kate Greenaway]] he asked her to draw her "girlies" (as he called her child figures) without clothing:

<blockquote>
Will you – (it's all for your own good – !) make her stand up and then draw her for me without a cap – and, without her shoes, – (because of the heels) and without her mittens, and without her – frock and frills? And let me see exactly how tall she is – and – how – round. It will be so good of and for you – And to and for me.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lurie |first=Alison |author-link=Alison Lurie |title=Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WROewAACAAJ |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] |date=20 July 1998 |isbn=9780316246255 |access-date=24 September 2020 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904071722/https://books.google.com/books?id=3WROewAACAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In a letter to his physician [[John Simon (pathologist)|John Simon]] on 15 May 1886, Ruskin wrote:

<blockquote>

Ruskin's biographers disagree about the allegation of "paedophilia". Tim Hilton, in his two-volume biography, asserts that Ruskin "was a paedophile" but leaves the claim unexplained, while John Batchelor argues that the term is inappropriate because Ruskin's behaviour does not "fit the profile".<ref>Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: A Life'', vol. 1, pp. 253–54; John Batchelor, ''John Ruskin: No Wealth but Life'', p. 202.</ref> Others point to a definite pattern of "[[Nympholepsy|nympholeptic]]" behaviour with regard to his interactions with girls at a [[Winnington Hall|Winnington school]].<ref>Wolfgang Kemp and Jan Van Heurck, ''The Desire of My Eyes: The Life and Work of John Ruskin '', p. 288.</ref> However, there is no evidence that Ruskin ever engaged in any sexual activity with anyone at all. According to one interpretation, what Ruskin valued most in pre-pubescent girls was their innocence; the fact that they were not (yet) fully developed sexual beings is what attracted him.<ref>''John Ruskin. The Last Visionary'', tx. 13 March 2000 (BBC1).</ref> An exploration of this topic by James L. Spates declares that "whatever idiosyncratic qualities his erotic expressions may have possessed, when it comes to matters of sexual capability and interest, there is every reason to conclude that John Ruskin was physically and emotionally normal."<ref>See James L.

===Common law of business balance===
Ruskin is frequently identified as the originator of the "[[common law of business balance]]"—a statement about the relationships of price and quality as they pertain to manufactured goods, and often summarised as: "The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot."

}}</ref> The signs listed Ruskin as the author of the statement, but the signs gave no information on where or when Ruskin was supposed to have written, spoken, or published the statement. Due to the statement's widespread use as a promotional slogan, and despite questions of Ruskin's authorship, it is likely that many people who are otherwise unfamiliar with Ruskin now associate him with this statement.

==Definitions==
[[File:John Ruskin 1850s 2.jpg|thumb|upright|John Ruskin in the 1850s]]
* [[Pathetic fallacy]]: Ruskin coined this term in ''Modern Painters'' III (1856) to describe the ascription of human emotions to inanimate objects and impersonal natural forces, as in "Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy" (Charlotte Brontë, ''Jane Eyre'').<ref>''Modern Painter''s III (see Part VI, "Of Many Things", c. XII, "Of the Paethetic Fallacy") see ''Works'' 5.201–220.</ref>
* [[Fors Clavigera]]: Ruskin gave this title to a series of letters he wrote "to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" (1871–84). The name was intended to signify three great powers that fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: ''force'', symbolised by the club (''clava'') of [[Hercules]]; ''For''titude, symbolised by the key (''clavis'') of Ulysses; and ''For''tune, symbolised by the nail (''clavus'') of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. These three powers (the "fors") together represent human talents and abilities to choose the right moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from [[Shakespeare]]'s phrase "There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune" (Brutus in ''Julius Caesar''). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.<ref>See ''Works'' 27.27–44 and 28.106–7.</ref><ref>For a full and concise introduction to the work, see Dinah Birch, "Introduction", in John Ruskin, ''Fors Clavigera'', ed. Dinah Birch (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. xxxiii–xlix.</ref>
* Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, as opposed to aesthetic – enables a vision of the beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, at least in terms of the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/04/ruskin-crown/ |title=The Fortnightly Review › Ruskin and the distinction between Aesthesis and Theoria |website=Fortnightlyreview.co.uk |date=7 April 2009 |access-date=18 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929015402/http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/04/ruskin-crown/ |archive-date=29 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see [[Peter Fuller]].<ref>Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' (Chatto and Windus, 1988).</ref>
* Modern Atheism: Ruskin applied this label to "the unfortunate persistence of the clergy in teaching children what they cannot understand, and in employing young consecrate persons to assert in pulpits what they do not know."{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}
* [[Illth]]: Used by Ruskin as the antithesis of wealth, which he defined as life itself; broadly, where wealth is 'well-being', illth is "ill-being".{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}
* Excrescence: Ruskin defined an "excrescence" as an outgrowth of the main body of a building that does not harmonise well with the main body. He originally used the term to describe certain [[gothic revival]] features<ref>{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 210}}</ref> also for later additions to cathedrals and various other public buildings, especially from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 396}}</ref>
